> This plugin is an experiment at this moment

SBT plugin to generate and validate graphql schemas written with Sangria.

See also: https://github.com/mediative/sangria-codegen

# Goals

This plugin is intended for testing pipelines that ensure that your graphql
schema and queries are intact and match. You should also be able to compare
it with another schema, e.g. the production schema, to avoid breaking changes.

# Features

All features are based on the excellent [Sangria GraphQL library](http://sangria-graphql.org)

* Schema generation - inspired by [mediative/sangria-codegen](https://github.com/mediative/sangria-codegen)
* Schema validation - [sangria schema validation](http://sangria-graphql.org/learn/#schema-validation)
* Schema validation against another schema - [sangria schema comparison](http://sangria-graphql.org/learn/#schema-comparison)
* Schema release note generation
* Query validation against your locally generated schema - [sangria query validation](http://sangria-graphql.org/learn/#query-validation)

# Usage

> This plugin is not yet released. You will have to build it yourself at this moment. Sorry for that :(

In your `build.sbt` enable the plugins and add sangria. I'm using circe as a parser for my json response.

```scala
enablePlugins(GraphQLSchemaPlugin, GraphQLQueryPlugin)

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria" % "1.3.0",
  "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria-circe" % "1.1.0"
)
``` 

## Schema generation

The schema is generated by accessing the application code via a generated main class that renders
your schema. The main class accesses your code via a small code snippet defined in `graphqlSchemaSnippet`.

Example:
My schema is defined in an object called `ProductSchema` in a field named `schema`.
In your `build.sbt` add

```scala
graphqlSchemaSnippet := "example.ProductSchema.schema"
``` 

Now you can generate a schema with

```bash
$ sbt graphqlSchemaGen
```

## Schema comparison

TODO - values are currently hardcoded and no setting available

## Schema release notes

## Query validation

The query validation uses the schema generated with `graphqlSchemaGen` to validate against all
graphql queries defined under `src/main/graphql`. Using separated `graphql` files for queries
is inspired by [apollo codegen](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen) which generates
typings for various languages.

To validate your graphql files run

```bash
sbt graphqlValidateQueries
```

You can change the source directory for your graphql queries with this line in
your `build.sbt`

```scala
sourceDirectory in (Compile, graphqlValidateQueries) := file("path/to/graphql")
```
